# second step
    i cloned my repo to vs code and modified.

    i used 
        git clone
        ls -Force (to see hidden files)
        clear
        git status (to see any added or deleted files that git dk)
                    and if not tracked..we use ("git add" command to add)
        git add . (to add all untracked from github)
        git add index.html ( to specificly add)
        git commin -m "m is message and we have ti put some message for        modification" 
                    -m "second m for description of the modification"

                (this wont update or make it live the repo in github)
        git push (this will update in gihub too)
